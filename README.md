‚ú® Intern Dashboard Project

A simple and clean dashboard application to track intern referral codes, donations, and rewards. This project includes a dummy login, a functional dashboard, and a mock backend API.

## üöÄ Features

###  Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS or React)
* *Dummy Login/Signup Page:* A static page for user authentication simulation (no backend authentication logic required).
* *Dashboard View:* After "logging in," users are directed to a dashboard that displays:
    * Intern's Name
    * A dummy referral code (e.g., yourname2025)
    * Total donations raised (a static number from the backend)
* *Rewards Section:* A static section to display potential rewards or unlockables.

### üîô Backend (Any Language/Framework)
* *Simple REST API:* A minimal API setup.
    * Returns mock data for the user's name, referral code, and total amount raised.
    * Can be easily mocked using Postman or a static JSON file.

### üèÜ Bonus Features (Optional)
* *Leaderboard Page:* A static page to display a list of top performers.
* *Data Persistence:* Option to store data in a non-dynamic way using Firebase, JSON files, or MongoDB.

## üõ† Tech Stack

This project is flexible, but here is a recommended stack:

* *Frontend:* React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
* *Backend:* Node.js with Express.js
* *Database (Optional):* Firebase or MongoDB for the bonus feature.
